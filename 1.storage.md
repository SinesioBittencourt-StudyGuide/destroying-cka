# Storage

## 1. Undestanding Kubernetes Storage Options

Dealing with container data brings up some challenges. Container data of a running application are ephemeral, that means that if a container crashes, kubelet can easily bring it back up, but the processed data by the containers are gone. Another challange is to share data between containers running in a Pod.

Kubernetes volume abstraction solves both of those problems.

A volume is a directory containing data, accessible to containers in a Pod.

### Types of Kubernetes Volumes

Kubernetes has many types of volumes, each of which has it's particularities. Choose it accordingly to the implementation needs. It also has specific cloud volumes integration.

### Example: Making Pod data persistent using emptyDir

To make the Pod data persistent we have some options:

- PersistentVolume Object: With the help of a claim(*PersistentVolumeClaim*) we define a PV(*PersistentVolume*) for use.
- ConfigMap: Is used to store files, directories and variables.
- Secrets: Encoded variables.

Pod using a shared volume between containers:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: sharedvolume
spec:
  containers:
  - name: centos1
    image: centos:7
    command:
    - sleep
    - "3600"
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /centos1
      name: test
  - name: centos2
    image: centos:7
    command:
    - sleep
    - "3600"
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /centos2
      name: test
  volumes:
  - name: test
    emptyDir: {}
```

## 2. Understand storage classes, persistent volumes

### Persistent Volume

PersistentVolume is a Kubernetes Object that define a Storage for running Pods.

- **PersistentVolumes** are storages that Pods are bounded to.
- The **Pod** makes a request for storage with *specified* requirements.
- The PersistentVolume needs to match the Pod requirements for storage.
- The **PersistentVolumeClaim** works as a *bridge* betwen the **PersistentVolume** and the **Pod**, matching their specifications.
- Pod doesn't care where the Volume is, it just needs to store information.

PersistentVolume Configuration example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-volume
  labels:
    type: local
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 2Gi
  accessModes:
  -  ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: "/mydata"
```

### Storage Classes

- Define a class type of storage.
- Storage Classes can make *specific* **PersistentVolumeClaims** bind to *specific* **PersistentVolumes** matching the same StorageClass only.
- In clusters, there's a **default StorageClass** offered to **PersistentVolumeClaims** that don't request any particular class to bind to.
- Default **StorageClass** are often provided in cloud environments.
- **PersistentVolumes** can be dinamically created by a **StorageClass**.
- Dinamically created **PersistentVolumes** needs a **reclaimPolicy** to defines what happens when to it when it's no longer used.

### Dealing with StorageClasses

```shell
# List all storage classes in the cluster
kubectl get storageclass 
```

```shell
# Generate a storage class yaml template
kubectl get storageclass -o yaml
```

StorageClass configuration example:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: standard
provisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs
parameters:
  type: gp2
reclaimPolicy: Retain
allowVolumeExpansion: true
mountOptions:
  - debug
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
```

## 3. Understand volume mode, access modes and reclaim policies for volumes

### Volume Modes

volumeMode is a optional API parameter, it provides a way to handle the volume access.

Kubernetes supports two volumeModes of PersistentVolumes:

#### Filesystem

- Default mode
- The volume is mounted inside Pods into a directory.
- Kubernetes creates a filesystem on the device before mounting it for the first time.(If it is in a empty block device)

#### Block

- Use a volume as a raw block device, without any filesystem on it.
- Provides the Pod a fastest possible way to access the volume without the Filesystem layer between the Pod and the Volume.
- The application running in a Pod needs to handle the raw block device.

&nbsp;

### Access Modes

Access Modes are a solution for matching PersistentVolumes that matches the volume criteria defined in Pods. It's options, as listed bellows, defines what type of volume the Pods are requesting, the coupling criteria is defined within a PersistentVolumeClaim.

A **PersistentVolumeClaim**, that has an AccessMode, searches for a **PersistentVolume** that matches it's AccessMode.

The access modes are:

- **ReadWriteOnce** -- the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node
- **ReadOnlyMany** -- the volume can be mounted read-only by many nodes
- **ReadWriteMany** -- the volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes

In the CLI, the access modes are abbreviated to:

- RWO - ReadWriteOnce
- ROX - ReadOnlyMany
- RWX - ReadWriteMany

### Reclaim Policy

Current reclaim policies are:

- Retain - manual reclamation
- Recycle - basic scrub (rm -rf /thevolume/*)
- Delete - associated storage asset such as AWS EBS, GCE PD, Azure Disk, or OpenStack Cinder volume is deleted

```shell
# Change a PersistentVolume reclaim policy
kubectl patch pv <your-pv-name> -p '{"spec":{"persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy":"Retain"}}'
```

## 4. Understand persistent volume claims primitive

A **PersistentVolumeClaim** (PVC) is a request for storage by a user. PVCs consume PV resources. Claims can request specific size and access modes (e.g., they can be mounted *ReadWriteOnce*, *ReadOnlyMany* or *ReadWriteMany*).

Each PVC contains a **spec** and **status**. The name of a **PersistentVolumeClaim** object must be a valid *DNS* subdomain name.

Pods access storage by using the claim as a volume.

### Persistent Volume Claims

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

## 5. Know how to configure applications with persistent storage

### Steps

1. Create a PersistentVolume backed by physical storage. You do not associate the volume with any Pod.

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolume
  metadata:
    name: pv-volume
    labels:
      type: local
  spec:
    capacity:
      storage: 2Gi
    accessModes:
    -  ReadWriteOnce
    hostPath: # 
      path: "/mydata"
  ```

2. You, now taking the role of a developer / cluster user, create a PersistentVolumeClaim that is automatically bound to a suitable PersistentVolume

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

3. You create a Pod that uses the above PersistentVolumeClaim for storage.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pv-pod
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: pv-storage # this set up the reference used by containers
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: pv-claim
  containers:
  - name: pv-container
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
      name: "http-server"
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: "/usr/share/nginx/html"
      name: pv-storage # equals to volume name
```
